* After analyzing the data, it was uncovered that 41,381 current employees are approaching retirement age and will be elligible to retire in the near future which will create many job openings that will need to be filled either internally or externally.
* Another finding exposed that departments most heavily affected by the upcoming retirements are going to be production(8174 future positions)  and development(9281 future positions). 
* As evidenced by the picture below, it was revealed that the majority of the employees retiring are Senior Staff, Senior Engineers and Engineers.

* As one of the solutions, a mentorship program was proposed and the data was used to identify current employees who are eligible  for the program. The criterion used for the determination of eligibility was date of birth between January 1, 1965 and December 31, 1965. The analysis produced a list of 1550 current employees who potentially can be engaged in this program with the opportunity to fill high-demand postions. 
## Summary and Recommnendations
At the moment at Pewlett Hackard,many current employees  are getting close to retirement. The departments most heavily affected are going to be production and development. The majority of the employees eligible to retire are currently holding senior positions which require extensive training and expertise which means the company is likely going to need an extensive hiring process in the upcoming years to inlcude junior and senior personnel. To better prepare the company for a sizable amount of its most experienced employees retiring, it is recommended to increase hiring of the junior personnel in the departments most heavily affected by the retirements in order to facilitate transitions of more experienced staff members into more senior roles.  Additionally, current mentorship initiative could be expanded to source more candidates internally to fill future positions.
